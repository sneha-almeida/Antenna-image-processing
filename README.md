# Antenna Image Processing

Processing-Signal-Images-to-Detect-Signals-in-Specific-Color-and-Locating-Required-Co-ordinates

A system was getting image files of the following form:


![antenna image](https://github.com/sneha-almeida/Antenna-image-processing/blob/main/73dcff5a-8f3a-4575-82b6-7d4551bee1ae.jpg)

The tasks of this system were to:
1) Recognize red colored contours

2) Isolate the countours

3) Find the midpoint of each contour
